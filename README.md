# Intro

PyTorch implementation of [Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474).

## Run

```bash
python main.py
```

### TODO
- [x] Initial implementation
- [x] Toy data
- [x] LSTM updates
- [ ] Refactor, find a better way to organize the modules
- [ ] Compare with standard optimizers
- [x] Real data
- [ ] More difficult models
